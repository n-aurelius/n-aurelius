- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @n-aurelius 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve always thought that when 'they' said medical was my path I, immature and anxious, thought "i guess psychiatry is cool [after watching a few serial killer documentaries]" and went ahead to take biology on where i was clearly never the last one standing. I discovered in 12th grade that it was actually neuroscience and philosophy that made up most of my questions. BUT, now I think neuroscience + philosophy + A.I. and that is a vast world that I'm willing to explore. Artificial Intelligence. Robots. And ofcourse, me. Humans today enjoy talking to a lifeless machine and whilst the machine (kinda like a sociopath) copies what humans would do, we on the other hand feel understood as if it was a human texting back to us. Robotic arms coded with all the information and an essense of an artificial life breath into their cpu so they could act as we please with a conscience of their own, a legal kind of slavery. We hit the target didn't we? That's all for now!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic stuff
