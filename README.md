- 👋 Hi, I’m @n-aurelius
- 👀 I’ve always thought that when 'they' said medical was my path I, immature and anxious, thought "yeah! I guess I like how brains function, isn't that psychology?" and went on to take biology on where i was clearly never the one standing at the end. I discovered in 12th grade it was actually neuroscience and philosophy that made up most of my questions. BUT, now it's even better. Artificial Intelligence. It's become an integral part of our lives, doing stuff i'd take hours to do in a second. Humans today enjoy talking to a lifeless machine and whilst the machine kind of like a sociopath copies what humans would do, we on the other hand feel understood as if it was a human on texting back. Honestly this all is nothing A.I. has partnered with human beings of every trade. That's all for now!
